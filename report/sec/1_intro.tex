\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
    This report documents the warm-up assignments and will be refined with each subsequent task completion. Additionally, it will incorporate details of new experiments undertaken in each assignment. The overarching goal is to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance by employing a diverse array of techniques. A dedicated section labeled "To-Do" will delineate pending tasks for discussion and action.
